summary: Filtering interactive content with crosstalk
weight: 400
rmarkdown: true
---







<p>This is a test of an interactive <code>RMarkdown</code> document
within the govuk-hugo theme, on 2022-04-07 using <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/"><code>{crosstalk}</code></a>
to interactively filter data.</p>
<div id="prepare-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Prepare data</h2>
<p><code>{crosstalk}</code> is an R package that supports interactive
Rmarkdown files, it is particularly useful for <code>govukhugo</code> as
it can support client-side data processing and therefore enables complex
interactivity without relying on Shiny. To use <code>{crosstalk}</code>
we initiate a <code>SharedData</code> object by a call to
<code>crosstalk::SharedData$new()</code>.</p>
<p>Compatability issues means this only works with tables (via
<code>govukhgo::govuk_datatable()</code>) and not yet with interactive
plots (via <code>{plotly}</code>), it has not yet been tested with
interactive maps (via <code>{leaflet}</code>).</p>
</div>
<div id="filtering-the-table" class="section level2">
<h2>Filtering the table</h2>
<p>Once enabled we can use <code>{crosstalk}</code> to filter the data
object, and to link tables and plots. At present only the
<code>filter_select()</code> and <code>filter_checkbo()</code> filters
are supported for use in <code>govukhugo</code>.</p>
{{< highlight r >}}fs_species <- crosstalk::filter_select(
  id = "filter-species",
  label = "Penguin species",
  sharedData = penguins_sd,
  group = ~species,
  multiple = FALSE
)

fs_island <- crosstalk::filter_select(
  id = "filter-island",
  label = "Island",
  sharedData = penguins_sd,
  group = ~island,
  multiple = TRUE
)

fs_sex <- crosstalk::filter_checkbox(
  id = "filter-sex",
  label = "Sex",
  sharedData = penguins_sd,
  group = ~sex,
  columns = 1
){{< /highlight >}}
<p><code>{crosstalk}</code> is designed to work with the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap CSS framework</a> which does
not work well with the GOV.UK Design System, therefore the filters
should be wrapped inside a call to <code>govukhugo::unstrap()</code> to
remove the Bootstrap dependencies.</p>
