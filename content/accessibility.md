This website is run by the Cabinet Office's Analysis & Insight Directorate. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

-  change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
- We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
